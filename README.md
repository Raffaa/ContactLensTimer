# ContactLensTimer - Lens...minder
Hey, this is the source code for the app Contact Lens Reminder present on the play store. Initially born as a trivial university project I've continued the development until it reached the level of "decent application", eligible to be published on Play Store.
If you want to try it here's the download link:
